# WingedFlyer

**Live updates for real-world events — powered by QR codes and simplicity.**

WingedFlyer is an open-source web app that helps **markets, fairs, and local events** share real-time information with visitors using **one printed QR code** — no app installation or login needed.

Organizers just **print once** → update info digitally → visitors scan the same QR → everyone sees the latest updates instantly.
